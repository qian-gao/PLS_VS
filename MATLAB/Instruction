PLSvar_sel

Variable selection based on bootstrapped-VIP scores calculated from different PLS models 

INPUT:

X        Array of independant variables, which is a two way or three way matrix. Mode 1, Subject;
         Mode 2, Metabolite; Mode 3, Time.
Y1       Array of dependent variables representing group infomation.
         E.g, Samples from intervention and control group are labelled with 1 and -1 respectively.
Y2       Array of dependant variables representing time response information. 
         E.g, Samples from response and non-response class are labelled with 10 and 1 respectively.
MaxFac   Maximal number of components
Type     Type of model to use
         1 bilinear X and group dummy Y

         3 bilinear X and group√ótime-response dummy Y
         4 trilinear X and group dummy Y
         5 trilinear X and group/time-response dummy Y
btnr     Number of bootstrap datasets
btmd     Resampling method for bootstrap. 1. Balanced resampling 2.Balanced resampling within individual groups.
